## 💻 Code Quality Highlights

### Python Best Practices
```python
# Type hints for clarity
def run_command(self, cmd: List[str], timeout: int = 300) -> Optional[str]:
    
# Comprehensive error handling
try:
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, timeout=timeout, check=False)
    return result.stdout if result.returncode == 0 else None
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    self.log(f"Command timed out: {' '.join(cmd)}", "red")
    return None
    
# Thread-safe operations
with self.lock:
    self.results['vulnerabilities'].append(vuln_data)
    
# Clean resource management
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(task) for task in tasks]
